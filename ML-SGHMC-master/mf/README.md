This is folder contains code for Bayesian matrix factorization based on SGHMC and SGLD sampler.

To run the experiment
* (1) cd code; make;
* (2) cd code/tools;make
* (3) download ml-1m dataset from movielens,  change Makefile DATA path to the unziped path of ml-1m
* (4) ./mkall.sh will make all the fold's input file
* (5) cd run; use runSGHMC.sh to run the experiment
